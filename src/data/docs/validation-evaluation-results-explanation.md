## Detailed Analysis Per Intent

### 1. Answer Intent

| Metric    | Value  | Interpretation                                           |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Precision | 83.33% | Of all predicted "answer" responses, 83.33% were correct |
| Recall    | 100%   | All actual "answer" responses were correctly identified  |
| F1-Score  | 90.91% | Strong balanced performance for "answer" classification  |

### 2. Other Intent

| Metric    | Value  | Interpretation                                            |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Precision | 96.55% | Of all predicted "other" responses, 96.55% were correct   |
| Recall    | 80%    | 80% of actual "other" responses were correctly identified |
| F1-Score  | 87.50% | Good balanced performance for "other" classification      |

### 3. Question Intent

| Metric    | Value  | Interpretation                                               |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Precision | 100%   | All predicted "question" responses were correct              |
| Recall    | 97.30% | 97.30% of actual "question" responses were identified        |
| F1-Score  | 98.63% | Excellent balanced performance for "question" classification |

## Confusion Matrix Analysis

```
Actual vs Predicted:
           Predicted
Actual    Answer  Other  Question
Answer      35      0       0
Other        7     28       0
Question     0      1      36
```

### Key Observations

1. **Answer Intent**

   - Perfect identification: No false negatives
   - Some false positives from "Other" category

2. **Other Intent**

   - Main challenge: 7 instances misclassified as "Answer"
   - High precision but lower recall

3. **Question Intent**
   - Nearly perfect performance
   - Only one instance misclassified as "Other"

## Average Metrics Comparison

### Macro Averages (Simple Average)

| Metric    | Value  |
| --------- | ------ |
| Precision | 93.30% |
| Recall    | 92.43% |
| F1-Score  | 92.35% |

### Weighted Averages (Sample-Size Considered)

| Metric    | Value  |
| --------- | ------ |
| Precision | 93.42% |
| Recall    | 92.52% |
| F1-Score  | 92.46% |

## Metric Definitions

### Basic Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions across all classes
- **Precision**: Proportion of correct positive predictions divided by total positive predictions
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual positives correctly identified
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

### Advanced Metrics

- **Macro Average**: Simple average of metrics across classes
  - Treats all classes equally regardless of size
- **Weighted Average**: Average weighted by class size
  - More representative for unbalanced datasets

## Conclusions

### Strengths

1. Excellent overall accuracy (>92%)
2. Outstanding performance on "question" classification (F1: 98.63%)
3. Strong performance on "answer" classification (F1: 90.91%)
4. Good performance on "other" classification (F1: 87.50%)

### Areas for Improvement

1. Reduce misclassification of "other" as "answer" (7 cases)
2. Investigate cause of single "question" misclassification

## Recommendations

### Short-term

1. Focus on improving "other" intent classification
2. Maintain current performance for "question" and "answer" intents
3. Review training examples for "other" category

### Long-term

1. Collect more examples of "other" intent
2. Monitor system performance over time
3. Consider periodic model retraining

## Technical Performance

- Processing time is acceptable for batch evaluation
- No errors during evaluation indicates stable system
- Good balance between accuracy and processing speed
